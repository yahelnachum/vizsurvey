      Some open questions about how to design the visualization are captured
      below. I didn't want to loose track of them, so I put them on this page. I
      also have a list of tasks to still do. For information on how the app is
      designed and works, see{" "}

          Should the time scale be fixed for the question set or not? <br></br>
          Right now, I fixed the time scale across the questions to be from 0 to
          the maximum time for the question set. I thought visually it stopped
          the bar chart from jumping around between the questions and the range
          of time values is not so large that it causes any of the charts to
          become too small along the x axis to render well; however from an
          experimental point of view, I am not sure if it will bias the subject
          in some way and I am not sure this is the best choice. It would be
          easy to drive this as a parameter from the input data for each
          experiment to turn it on and off so that the time scale could be set
          to be consistent across the questions or let it format uniquely for
          each question.
        </li>
        <li>
          Should the y scale range be fixed for the question set? I did not fix
          the y range to the same scale between questions since the variation in
          the amount values is larger and the chart bars with smaller amounts
          would be too compressed in the y axis too small to be meaninful. I did
          fix the number of ticks for the y scale to be the same across
          questions in the set since visually it seems easier to comprehend
          between quesitons; however I need to fix the algorithm since it ends
          up with strange interval values if the largest amount in the qustion
          set is not a divided by 5 to a normal looking v alue. Not sure if that
          is a good decision. Again, this would be easy to paramaterize through
          the input data.
        </li>
        <li>I need to get the vertical line to draw for the y axis.</li>
        <li>
          I need to get the survey results to save on either gist or a google
          sheets document may be better since I can't append to a gist file
          through the API. I may create a new gist file for each survey results.
        </li>
        <li>
          I need to pass the question set (question configuration) through the
          URL and use it to load the correct set of questions. Then I can change
          the URL link that I embed into the mechanical turk experiment run.
        </li>
        Fix code so that it works in firefox. Test it on other browsers (Edge,
        Safari) and make sure it works for those.
